The database includes entities such as Tournament, Team, Player, Referee, Match, Event, and Standing (for team rankings and points), along with their relationships, enabling:

- Tracking teams and their participation in tournaments
- Recording all matches and events (goals, cards)
- Analyzing team and player statistics
- Determining tournament winners and leaderboard standings

## ERD
